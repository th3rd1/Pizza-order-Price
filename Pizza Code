# I was surprised this worked. Didn't take as long as I expected either / Realized what I first wrote didn't work. Had if add_pepperoni == "Y": under small and further down so larger sizes got the correct amount billed, but if size was S it added $3 and $2. Was able to revise to current code

# Originally had if add_pepperoni under each size but realized it was redudnant and moved to under the first if statement closed/ (originally kept it under small size if statmement but that didn't work)

# Took longest time with the adding pepperoni variable after figuring out the original issue. Forgot a += and had just Bill+3 which stumped me for awhile
